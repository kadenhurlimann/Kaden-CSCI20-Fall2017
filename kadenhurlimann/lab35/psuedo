make a class called TemperatureConverter 
give it a single private variable of kelvin
make a default constructor that should make kelvin 0 by default
make an overloaded constructor that takes a single value (kelvin)
"if" kelvin is less than 0 print an error and end or kill the function
create the following public functions
SetTempFromCelsius converts to kelvin and stores no less than -273.15
SetTempFromKelvin stores value no less than 0
SetTempFromFahrenheit converts to kelvin and stores no less than -459.67
GetTempFromKelvin returns the kelvin value
GetTempAsCelsius returns the celcsius value
GetTempAsFahrenheit returns the fahrenheit value
PrintTemperatures couts all the return of all three Get functions

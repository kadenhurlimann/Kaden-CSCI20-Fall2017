// Write a program that takes in a runner’s race time in minutes and seconds 
// for a runner and computes and displays the speed in feet per seconds and meters per seconds.
// It should compare that to the first place times and tell the user the difference from the winner.
// Determine a runners splits for each ¼ mile.





input runners time and input the first place time as two different variables first minutes then seconds.
distance of race in miles with a double. 
multiply the distance by four, for 1/4 mile split.
divide original time by this value.
multiply distance by 5280 to calculate feet.
multiply minutes by 60 and add to seconds
divide feet by total time in seconds save as speed in feet.
mulitply speed in feet by 0.3048 and save to speed in meters
subtract winner time from user time.
subtract user speed from winner speed.
display the speed of user and winner in feet per second and meters per second.
display the difference between the user and the winner in both speed and finish time.
